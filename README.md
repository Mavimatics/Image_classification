# Project Overview:
This project involves implementing a command-line tool that uses a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds in pet images. The tool will take user-provided pet images and classify them using a pre-trained model. The results will be compared to known pet image labels to determine if the classifier correctly identifies the breed. The project consists of several key components, and success criteria are defined for each of them.
